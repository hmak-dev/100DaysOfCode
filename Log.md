### Day 1: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a particle effect in HTML5 canvas that uses a provided image and translates the image into little dots. Then dots will be thrown around with the mouse movement. 

**Thoughts**: This was one of my favorite effects that I never had the chance to work on it. So when it was finished I was so satisfied... ;)

### Day 2: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This night I started to work on a glitch effect on HTML5 canvas. So I started by displacing channels and then distorting the image. Now I know how to make glitch on an image. At the end I tried to animate and randomize this process.

**Thoughts**: This glitch effect is dope. But I think it could be so much better.

### Day 3: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This project is about audio visualizations and it was cool so I had to learn how to work with AudioContext API in browser.

**Thoughts**: This project can be so much better. I need to free my mind to get some cool ideas for this one...

### Day 4: December 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Here I created a CSS text effect that is controlled with Javascript. I saw this effect a long time ago and I was wondering how it can be done.

**Thoughts**: This is good but it has a little bug that there is a tiny gap between the steps that I should fix it in the future.

### Day 5: December 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This CSS 3D box will emit circles to the mouse direction. The original idea is from [Yusuke Nakaya](https://codepen.io/YusukeNakaya/full/OGwmOV). I just recreated the wheel.

**Thoughts**: I tried to manage CSS 3D transforms and creating such animations...

### Day 6: December 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Using css blur and a high contrast we can create a Goo effect in css. But there is an alternative way to do it with SVG color matrix and filters.

**Thoughts**: This method has some performance issues and CSS method also has some color issues and I don't know how it can be fixed :D

### Day 7: November 11, 2020

It's been almost a year since I committed my day 006. I was so busy with some projects. 

**Today's Progress:** Anyway, I am here with my 7th day. I've built a rotating DNA with HTML5 Canvas. It was meant to be used in a website landing page. I thought it is a good idea to put it in my 100 days challenge collection.

**Thoughts**: It was a challenge to make the animations smooth and sync all those dots together. Also required some simple mathematics to calculate the sine wave around the DNA shape.
