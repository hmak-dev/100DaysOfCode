### Day 1: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a particle effect in HTML5 canvas that uses a provided image and translates the image into little dots. Then dots will be thrown around with the mouse movement. 

**Thoughts:** This was one of my favorite effects that I never had the chance to work on it. So when it was finished I was so satisfied... ;)

### Day 2: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This night I started to work on a glitch effect on HTML5 canvas. So I started by displacing channels and then distorting the image. Now I know how to make glitch on an image. At the end I tried to animate and randomize this process.

**Thoughts:** This glitch effect is dope. But I think it could be so much better.
