# 100DaysOfCode

Now it is time to order my mind and start good new habits in my life.
This is going to be a great challenge in which I code at least an hour a day and post it in here to share my results on social media.

You can find all of my progress and source codes here in this repo.

**I recommend** every programmer to try this challenge since this is so exciting and gives you a lot of experience and motivation.
